# ----------
# 
# As with the previous perceptron exercises, you will complete some of the core
# methods of a sigmoid unit class.
#
# There are two functions for you to finish:
# First, in activate(), write the sigmoid activation function.
# Second, in update(), write the gradient descent update rule. Updates should be
#   performed online, revising the weights after each data point.
